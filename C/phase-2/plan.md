# Phase 2 Validation Plan

## Baseline and Boundaries

Validation starts from clean commit `c33ba71bc845ce022366fa15656a746efc6f92a6`, which matches `origin/main`. Treat every Phase 1 claim as unverified. Phase 2 may make only narrow requirement-blocking fixes and stops before adversarial, stress, security, or performance work.

## Evidence Strategy

1. Inventory every original requirement in one traceability matrix with stable IDs, direct validation methods, observed results, evidence links, and honest status.
2. Generate reproducible, non-sensitive PDF fixtures for normal, multi-page, mixed-size, rotated, linearized/range, large, encrypted, annotated, bookmarked, widget, malformed, merge, extraction, and secret-redaction cases. Keep large artifacts generated rather than committed.
3. Add deterministic inspection helpers that reopen exported PDFs and report page count, order markers, dimensions, rotation, annotations, outlines, widgets, MIME/signature, and extracted text.
4. Run controlled Chromium and Firefox principal workflows. Capture network/worker evidence for range loading and WebAssembly, and record any unavailable browser capability without substituting a claim.
5. Record every observed defect before correction. Apply only the smallest fix, re-run the blocked flow, and preserve failure/revalidation evidence.
6. Freeze the final validated application commit. Capture a small screenshot set from that exact code revision with consistent, non-private fixtures and viewports.
   Review those screenshots at desktop and tablet widths for toolbar alignment, page centering, clipping, overflow, panel spacing, visible focus, and overall presentation. Use measured geometry when appearance alone is ambiguous.
7. Complete the validation report, defect log, Codex evidence, AI-output corrections, architecture/README review, and screenshot index. Publish a clean repository.

The user-supplied viewer screenshot is a visual-QA reference only. It is not final evidence because it predates the final Phase 2 commit.

## Required Validation Passes

- SDK boundary, all source types, callbacks, repeated loads, and instance isolation.
- Loading, password/error/cancel flows, HTTP ranges, first-page timing, and no duplicate/full idle acquisition.
- Viewing/navigation, real fit behavior, selectable text, high-DPI backing store, and lazy large-document rendering.
- Transactional editor operations plus combined export/reopen inspection.
- Print/export filenames, MIME/signature, edited-state use, popup failure, and resource cleanup.
- Worker/WASM execution, responsiveness observation, and architecture responsibility match.
- Native annotations, rotated/zoomed coordinates, persistence, and irreversible secret removal.
- Bookmark CRUD/persistence and existing widget/signature-field inspection.
- Keyboard, focus, names/live regions, contrast scan, desktop/tablet/browser-zoom layouts.
- Root install/start commands, licensing/source delivery, privacy claims, and documentation consistency.

## Completion Gate

Do not report success while any mandatory matrix row is `PARTIAL`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED`. Bonus signature/widget creation remains an honest API limitation unless implementation changes. Screenshots alone never prove PDF structure, range behavior, WASM execution, redaction removal, or cleanup; pair them with logs or inspected artifacts. Captain, vice-captain, and documentation reviews must all pass before Phase 2 closes.
